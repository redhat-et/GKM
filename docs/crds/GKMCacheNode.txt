KIND:       GKMCacheNode
VERSION:    v1alpha1

DESCRIPTION:
    GKMCacheNode contains the state on a given Kubernetes Node of the set of
    GKMCache instances created in the same Namespace. When one or more GKMCache
    instance are created in a namespace, GKM ensures that one GKMCacheNode
    instance is created per Kubernetes Node. GKMCacheNode cannot be edited by an
    application or user, only by GKM.

    for each.
    
FIELDS:

    compatibleGPUs is the list of GPU ids that the extracted GPU Kernel Cache
    is compatible with. The ids refer back to the list of GPUs in status.gpus.

    conditions contains the summary state for the GPU Kernel Cache on the
    Kubernetes node referenced by status.nodeName.

  incompatibleGPUs	<[]integer>
    incompatibleGPUs is the list of GPU ids that the extracted GPU Kernel Cache
    is not compatible with. The ids refer back to the list of GPUs in
    status.gpus.

  lastUpdated	<string> -required-
    lastUpdated contains the timestamp of the last time this cache instance was
    updated.

  volumeIds	<[]string>
    volumeIds is the list of Volume Ids the CSI Driver received from Kubelet.
    Each Id represents a GPU Kernel Cache that is actively Volume Mounted in a
    pod.

VERSION:    v1alpha1

FIELD: conditions <[]Object>


DESCRIPTION:
    conditions contains the summary state for the GPU Kernel Cache on the
    Kubernetes node referenced by status.nodeName.
    Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API
    Resource.
    
FIELDS:
  lastTransitionTime	<string> -required-
    lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one
    status to another.
    This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known,
    then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

  message	<string> -required-
    message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
    This may be an empty string.

  observedGeneration	<integer>
    observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition
    was set based upon.
    For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the
    .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
    with respect to the current state of the instance.

  reason	<string> -required-
    reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the
    condition's last transition.
    Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and
    meanings for this field,
    and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
    The value should be a CamelCase string.
    This field may not be empty.

  status	<string> -required-
  enum: True, False, Unknown
    status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

  type	<string> -required-

    deployed on.

  nodeErrorCnt	<integer> -required-
    nodeErrorCnt contains the total number of nodes that the Kernel Cache
    encounter an error. An error occurs if the OCI Image could not be extracted

    with any of the GPUs detected on the Kubernetes node.

  nodeInUseCnt	<integer> -required-
    nodeInUseCnt contains the total number of nodes that the Kernel Cache has
    been extracted and that the Kernel Cache is currently being used by one or
    more pods on that node.

  nodeNotInUseCnt	<integer> -required-
    nodeNotInUseCnt contains the total number of nodes that the Kernel Cache
    has been extracted and that the Kernel Cache is not currently being used by
    a pod on that node.

  podOutdatedCnt	<integer> -required-
    podOutdatedCnt contains the total number of pods that the Kernel Cache is
    volume mounted, but a newer version of the extracted Kernel Cache has been
    extracted. This happens when a Kernel Cache is being used, but the
    associated OCI Image was updated.

  podRunningCnt	<integer> -required-
    podRunningCnt contains the total number of pods that the Kernel Cache is
    volume mounted.
