          ClusterGKMCache is the Schema for the cluster scoped GKMCaches API. Using
          this API allows applications to pre-populate a GPU Kernel Cache in a Pod,
          allowing the application to avoid having to build the kernel on the fly. The
          cache is packaged in an OCI Image, which is referenced in the
          ClusterGKMCache.

          The ClusterGKMCache.status field can be used to determine if any error
          occurred in the loading of the GPU Kernel Cache. Because one image can be
          loaded on multiple Kubernetes nodes, ClusterGKMCache.status is just a
          summary, all loaded or something failed. GKM creates a ClusterGKMCacheNode
          CR instance for each Kubernetes Node for each ClusterGKMCache instance. The
          ClusterGKMCacheNode CRD provides load status for each GPU Kernel Cache for
          each GPU on the node.

              spec defines the desired state of the ClusterGKMCache instance and describes
