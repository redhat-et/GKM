          GKMCache is the Schema for the namespace scoped GKMCaches API. Using this
          API allows applications to pre-populate a GPU Kernel Cache in a Pod,
          allowing the application to avoid having to build the kernel on the fly. The
          cache is packaged in an OCI Image, which is referenced in the GKMCache.

          The GKMCache.status field can be used to determine if any errors occurred in
          the loading of the GPU Kernel Cache. Because one image can be loaded on
          multiple Kubernetes nodes, GKMCache.status is just a summary, all loaded or
          something failed. GKM creates a GKMCacheNode CR instance for each Kubernetes
          Node for each GKMCache instance. The GKMCacheNode CRD provides load status
          for each GPU Kernel Cache for each GPU on the node.

              spec defines the desired state of the GKMCache. The GKMCache describes a GPU
              Kernel Cache that can be deployed by a Pod. The GPU Kernel Cache is packaged
              in an OCI Image which allows the cache to be distributed to Nodes.

              successfully or not across all nodes. Use GKMCacheNode or
              ClusterGKMClusterNode instances to determine the status for a given node.
